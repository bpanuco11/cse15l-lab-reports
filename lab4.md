Log into ieng6<br><br>

To log into ieng6 instead of typing my full username as an argument to ssh: `ssh cs15lfa23__@ieng6-201.ucsd.edu`, I used `Ctr-R` to reverse search for my long username considering
that I am aware that I have typed it many times prior, so it should be in my history. I then press `<enter>` to confirm that the reverse ssearch command has found my desired
command. One thing that I learned from the `<enter>` key while using `Ctr-R` is that the `<enter>` key will confirm and run the command found by the reverse search.
